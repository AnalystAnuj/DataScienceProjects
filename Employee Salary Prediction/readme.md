# Employee Salary Prediction 🌐💰

## Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict employee salaries based on various factors. The predictive model is designed to assist human resources and hiring teams in estimating appropriate salary ranges during the recruitment process.

## Features

- Machine learning model for predicting employee salaries 🤖📊.
- User-friendly script and web interface for easy salary predictions 🖥️🌐.
- Comprehensive dataset with diverse employee-related features.

## Model Overview

The project employs a machine learning model, such as linear regression, to estimate salary ranges for employees. The model is trained on a rich dataset that includes information about employees' experience, education, and other relevant factors.

### How the Model Works:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset containing diverse employee-related features, including years of experience, education level, job role, etc.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

3. **Model Training:**
   - Use machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, to train the model on the prepared dataset.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared on a validation set.

5. **Prediction and Deployment:**
   - Deploy the trained model in a user-friendly script or web interface to predict employee salaries based on user input.
