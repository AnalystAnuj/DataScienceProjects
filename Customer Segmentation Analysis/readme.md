# Customer Segmentation Analysis 📊🤖

## Overview

This project employs machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering and XGBoost, for customer segmentation analysis. The goal is to categorize customers based on their behavior and characteristics, providing actionable insights for targeted marketing and personalized strategies.

## Features

- Customer segmentation using K-means clustering 🤖📈.
- Predictive modeling with XGBoost to enhance segmentation accuracy 🚀.
- In-depth analysis and visualization of customer clusters 📊🔍.

## Model Overview

The project combines K-means clustering for initial segmentation and XGBoost for refining the clusters. The clustering identifies distinct customer groups, while XGBoost enhances the segmentation by considering additional features.

### How the Models Work:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Gather a dataset containing diverse customer-related features, such as purchase history, demographics, and website interactions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and normalize/encode features as needed.

3. **K-means Clustering:**
   - Utilize K-means clustering to categorize customers into distinct segments based on their behavior and characteristics.

4. **XGBoost Model:**
   - Train an XGBoost model to refine the clusters, considering additional features for improved accuracy.

5. **Customer Analysis:**
   - Analyze and visualize the characteristics of each customer segment to derive actionable insights.
