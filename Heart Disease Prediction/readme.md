## Logistic Regression for Heart Disease Prediction

This project utilizes logistic regression as the primary machine learning algorithm for predicting the likelihood of heart disease. Logistic regression is chosen due to its effectiveness in binary classification tasks, making it well-suited for predicting the presence or absence of heart disease based on health parameters.

### How Logistic Regression is Used:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The dataset, containing various health-related features and heart disease labels, is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical variables, and encode categorical features.

2. **Feature Selection:**
   - Relevant features are selected based on exploratory data analysis and domain knowledge. Feature engineering may be employed to create new meaningful variables.

3. **Model Training:**
   - The logistic regression model is trained on a portion of the dataset using a suitable training-validation split. The algorithm learns the relationships between selected features and heart disease labels during this phase.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - The trained logistic regression model is evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its performance. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve are used to measure the model's effectiveness.

5. **Prediction and Deployment:**
   - Once the model demonstrates satisfactory performance, it can be used for making predictions on new, unseen data. The prediction script or web interface incorporates the logistic regression model to provide real-time predictions for users.

### Model Tuning and Improvement:

The project may involve hyperparameter tuning and iterative model improvement to enhance the logistic regression model's predictive capabilities. Contributors are encouraged to experiment with different configurations and suggest improvements to optimize model performance.
